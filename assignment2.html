                        // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.

                Calculations:

                V = I * R

                Red: 5V-1.8V = 3.2V
                3.2 = 20mA * R
                3.2/0.02 = R
                R = 160 ohms
                I chose a resistor with 330 ohms:
                V/I has to be less than 30mA
                3.2/330 = 9.7mA so it works but will be dim, I can't go down to 100ohms because 3.2/100 = 32.0mA which is above 30mA

                Yellow: 5V-1.8V = 3.2V
                3.2 = 20mA * R
                3.2/0.02 = R
                R = 160 ohms
                I chose a resistor with 330 ohms:
                V/I has to be less than 30mA
                3.2/330 = 9.7mA so it works but will be dim, I can't go down to 100ohms because 3.2/100 = 32.0mA which is above 30mA

                Blue: 5V-3.3V = 1.7V
                1.7 = 20mA * R
                1.7/0.02 = R
                R = 85 ohms
                I chose a resistor with 220 ohms:
                V/I has to be less than 30mA
                1.7/220 = 7.7mA so it works but will be dim, I can't go down to 10ohms because 1.7/10 = 170.0mA which is above 30m
