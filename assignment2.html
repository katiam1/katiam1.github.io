                Calculations:

                Red LED Resistor:
                    5V-1.8V = 3.2V
                    3.2 = 20mA * R
                    3.2/0.02 = R
                    R = 160 ohms
                    Closest resistor I have above it is 220 ohms:
                    V/I has to be less than 30mA
                    3.2/220 = 14.5mA so it works the best, I can't go down to 100ohms because 3.2/100 = 32.0mA which is above 30mA

                https://forum.arduino.cc/t/why-10k-resistor-for-a-push-button/434354/4
                Using a 10K resistor
                max current you can pull from an arduino is 250mA, so you need to select a resistor that minimizes the energy consumption and also doesnt pull 250mA
                5V = 0.25 * R
                5/0.25 = 20 ohms, so the minimum resistance I need to protect my arduino uno is 20, but since I also want to use very little energy for it, I am choosing to use 10k ohms.
